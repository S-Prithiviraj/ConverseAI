# ConverseAI
A Conversational Insight Platform

ConverseAI: Conversational Analytics Platform analyzes audio and video content to extract valuable insights. It transcribes panel discussions and customer-agent interactions using a deep learning-based ASR model, accommodating various accents and speaking styles. The transcriptions are processed with NLP techniques to identify key topics and extract metadata like speaker details and conversation duration. Sentiment analysis classifies statements as positive, negative, or neutral. Insightify provides actionable insights, such as summarizing discussions and assessing customer satisfaction, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware summaries and query handling.
